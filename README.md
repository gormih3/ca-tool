# pa-tool
The PA Tool is part of the AIM Community Tools, a collection of tools created to facilitate the process to the different Cardano Project Catalyst roles.

[LIVE VERSION](https://cardanocataly.st/pa-tool/#/)

The AIM Community Tools were first developed and used in Funds 4, 5 and 6 and our first proposal was funded in [Fund 5](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350981-48088).
The updates to the tools were successfully funded in [Fund 6](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368917-48088).

The __PA Tool__ was created to help Proposal Assessors in the selection of proposals with the lowest number of assessments in order to better distribute the workload among them and guarantee the minimum number of assessments required for all proposals.

## Features
During the various funds a number of features were included, like:

- Proposal suggestion based on number of assessments
- Proposal filtering by challenge
- Mechanism to keep track of assessed proposals
- Self-checklist for PAs with guiding questions to improve quality of assessments

Other features will be added for fund7, you can track the progress [here](https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/ca-tool/projects/1).

## API and data
Currently the IdeaScale API is not public and in order to pull the data needed for the tool we developed a [small script](https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/ca-tool-backend) which is run by the IOG team that updates data.
